msgid "## `cond`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`case` is useful when you need to match against different values. However, in "
"many circumstances, we want to check different conditions and find the first o"
"ne that evaluates to true. In such cases, one may use `cond`:"
msgstr ""
"`case` は様々な値に対してマッチさせたい時に有用です。それでも、様々な条件を調べて最初に true と評価されるものを見つけたいことが往々にしてありま"
"す。そういった場合に取る方法のひとつが `cond` です。"

"This is equivalent to `else if` clauses in many imperative languages (although"
" used way less frequently here)."
msgstr "これは多くの命令型言語における `else if` に相当するものです(ここではあまり使われません)。"

msgid ""
"If none of the conditions return true, an error (`CondClauseError`) is raised."
" For this reason, it may be necessary to add a final condition, equal to `true"
"`, which will always match:"
msgstr ""
"true を返す条件が見つからないと (`CondClauseError`) になります。この理由は、そういった時に最後では必ず `true` に等しくなる"

msgid "Finally, note `cond` considers any value besides `nil` and `false` to be true:"
msgstr "最後に、 `cond` は `nil` と `false` 以外の如何なる値も `true` と見なすことを覚えておきましょう。"

msgid "## `if` and `unless`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides `case` and `cond`, Elixir also provides the macros `if/2` and `unless/"

msgid ""
"If the condition given to `if/2` returns `false` or `nil`, the body given betw"
"een `do/end` is not executed and instead it returns `nil`. The opposite happen"

msgid "They also support `else` blocks:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> if nil do\n"

msgid ""
"> Note: An interesting note regarding `if/2` and `unless/2` is that they are i"
"mplemented as macros in the language; they aren't special language constructs "
"as they would be in many languages. You can check the documentation and the so"
"urce of `if/2` in [the `Kernel` module docs](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel."
"html). The `Kernel` module is also where operators like `+/2` and functions li"
"ke `is_function/2` are defined, all automatically imported and available in yo"
"ur code by default."

msgid "## `do/end` blocks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At this point, we have learned four control structures: `case`, `cond`, `if`, "
"and `unless`, and they were all wrapped in `do/end` blocks. It happens we coul"
"d also write `if` as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> if true, do: 1 + 2\n"
"3\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how the example above has a comma between `true` and `do:`, that's beca"
"use it is using Elixir's regular syntax where each argument is separated by a "
"comma. We say this syntax is using *keyword lists*. We can pass `else` using k"
"eywords too:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> if false, do: :this, else: :that\n"
":that\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`do/end` blocks are a syntactic convenience built on top of the keywords one. "
"That's why `do/end` blocks do not require a comma between the previous argumen"
"t and the block. They are useful exactly because they remove the verbosity whe"
"n writing blocks of code. These are equivalent:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> if true do\n"
"...>   a = 1 + 2\n"
"...>   a + 10\n"
"...> end\n"
"13\n"
"iex> if true, do: (\n"
"...>   a = 1 + 2\n"
"...>   a + 10\n"
"...> )\n"
"13\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One thing to keep in mind when using `do/end` blocks is they are always bound "
"to the outermost function call. For example, the following expression:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> is_number if true do\n"
"...>  1 + 2\n"
"...> end\n"
"** (CompileError) iex:1: undefined function is_number/2\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid "Would be parsed as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> is_number(if true) do\n"
"...>  1 + 2\n"
"...> end\n"
"** (CompileError) iex:1: undefined function is_number/2\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"which leads to an undefined function error because that invocation passes two "
"arguments, and `is_number/2` does not exist. The `if true` expression is inval"
"id in itself because it needs the block, but since the arity of `is_number/2` "
"does not match, Elixir does not even reach its evaluation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Adding explicit parentheses is enough to bind the block to `if`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"```iex\n"
"iex> is_number(if true do\n"
"...>  1 + 2\n"
"...> end)\n"
"true\n"
"```"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keyword lists play an important role in the language and are quite common in m"
"any functions and macros. We will explore them a bit more in a future chapter."
" Now it is time to talk about \"Binaries, strings, and char lists\"."
